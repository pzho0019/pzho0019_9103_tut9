The Inspiration point of these two image of Star Wars shortcut is the background
of it. The tehnique it use is making a animation of incoming light ray. It give 
audience a sense of moving forward in the space. Meanwhile it is a loop, which means
it is easy to create and implement into our project. What's more, base on the loop,
we can modify the code to make it able to change colors randomly.
## Part two

[Link of Code](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/arrays/falling-points)
The technique it use is loop. In this code, developer use loop to create a snow simulation.
The reuslt is that the white point will move vertically from top to the button.
Based on this code, we can modify it to make multiple line moving from the center of
image to the edge of the screen. Giving people a sense of moving forward.
